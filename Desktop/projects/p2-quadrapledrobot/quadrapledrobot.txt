-> Quadrapled robots are 4 legged robots those perform certain household tasks such as vacuuming or gardening This robot is programmed to move in 2 different modes that are: -

1. Control via remote - Where robot is controlled by a Bluetooth device like mobile or laptop.
2. Automatic path - In the mode the robot walks automatically while avoiding any obstacles coming in its path.

1)It has 4 legs,3 degree of freedom per leg and it follows a 2-phase discontinuous gait called creep gait.
2)It uses Arduino mega 2560 as its brain, which is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega2560.
3)It uses 13 SG90 servo motors as its actuator. It can rotate 180 degrees with an operating speed of 0.1s/60 degrees and produce a torque of 1.8 kgf.cm at operating voltage of 5v.
4)It uses HC06 Bluetooth module for communication of the robot with the mobile or laptop applications to control the robot. it has range of 10m approximately.
5)The robot is powered by using a smps power supply. The voltage supplied is 5v and the maximum current drawn by the robot is 4 amps.
6)The robot weighs 270 grams and it can carry a load of 100 grams safely.
